# gRPC

This project was used to learn how works gRPC communication and how to implement using Go Lang.

- Created a .proto file that describes the entities and service methods
- Used grpc lib for Go to read the .protofile and generate all implementations in Go Lang
- Created a UserService sample that implements gRPC interfaces that have been generated
- Created a Server and Client to run and simulate two micro services communicating using gRPC
